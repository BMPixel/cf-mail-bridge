- To implement and test new feature online: build, commit and then deploy.
- Always use `npx wrangler` instead of `wrangler` directly since global wrangler has been uninstalled.
- All wrangler commands should be prefixed with `npx`, for example:
  - `npx wrangler deploy`
  - `npx wrangler dev`
  - `npx wrangler tail`
  - `npx wrangler d1 execute`
