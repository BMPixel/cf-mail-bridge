1. Draft a detailed todo list for the project.
2. Implement the project step by step.
3. Setup a simple test environment.

- Whenever you want to implement a new feature, please first check if a reliable solution is already available like a library.
- You should write test case and test code BEFORE you start implementing the feature.
- And after you finish implementing the feature, you should write test code to test the feature.
- NEVER use mock value in production code.
